    <h3>Introduction</h3>
    <p>A mathematical model is a mathematical description (often by means of a function or an equation) of a real-world phenomenon such as the size of a population, the demand for a product, the speed of a falling object, the concentration of a product in a chemical reaction, the life expectancy of a person at birth, or the cost of emission reductions. The purpose of the model is to understand the phenomenon and perhaps to make predictions about future behavior.</p>
    <p>Figure 1 illustrates the process of mathematical modeling. Given a real-world problem, our first task is to formulate a mathematical model by identifying and naming the inde- pendent and dependent variables and making assumptions that simplify the phenomenon enough to make it mathematically tractable. We use our knowledge of the physical situation and our mathematical skills to obtain equations that relate the variables. In situations where there is no physical law to guide us, we may need to collect data (either from a library or the Internet or by conducting our own experiments) and examine the data in the form of a table in order to discern patterns. From this numerical representation of a function we may wish to obtain a graphical representation by plotting the data. The graph might even sug- gest a suitable algebraic formula in some cases.</p>
    <p>The second stage is to apply the mathematics that we know (such as the calculus that will be developed throughout this book) to the mathematical model that we have formulated in order to derive mathematical conclusions. Then, in the third stage, we take those mathe- matical conclusions and interpret them as information about the original real-world phe- nomenon by way of offering explanations or making predictions. The final step is to test our predictions by checking against new real data. If the predictions donâ€™t compare well with reality, we need to refine our model or to formulate a new model and start the cycle again.</p>

    <h3>Linear Models</h3>
    <p>When we say that y is a linear function of x, we mean that the graph of the function is a line, so we can use the slope-intercept form of the equation of a line to write a formula for where m is the slope of the line and b is the y-intercept.</p>
    <p>A characteristic feature of linear functions is that they grow at a constant rate. For in-stance, Figure 2 shows a graph of the linear function f  x    3x   2 and a table of sample values. Notice that whenever x increases by 0.1, the value of f  x  increases by 0.3. So f  x  increases three times as fast as x. Thus the slope of the graph y   3x   2, namely 3, can be interpreted as the rate of change of y with respect to x.</p>
